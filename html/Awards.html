                    An overview to my education and achievements 
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Certificate of Academic Excellence: stood 1 st in my class
                    from elementary school till I finished my high school days.
                    I only failed to stand 1 st in my class only in 2 semesters to
                    only be ranked 2 nd and 3 rd on those semesters when I was
                    in high school(from 2015/16 â€“ 2018/19)- A high School Average of 92.
                    Currently studying at Addis Ababa University.
                    Certificate of Success: 4 th in an Ethiopian Mathematics
                    Olympiads hosted by Nejashi Ethio-Turkish International
                    Schools in 2014 and 5 th in 2013.
                    Participated in the IT club for 2 years when I was in high
                    school.
                    Participated in the Science and Technology club in
                    middle school and high school.
                    Summer camp football.
                    If I can anything for sure about myself about my personality, it's my
competitiveness. Throughout my academic career, I always performed 2nd to none in any class I have been. It doesn't matter what sort of challenge is being thrown at
me, as long as I'm in it, I will make sure to give it my best and mostly achieve a
satisfactory results in the end. I don't want to be scoring lower than any person who has been given the same opportunity as me. To be taking my class in STUD is a
dream and if it comes true, I want to be one of the top scorers and strive to get the most what's being provided to me and make something tangible out of it and also a
visible difference and outcomes in personally and academically as I move forward to my career life.
I have always looked in to options where I can widen my repertoire. I believe that what I learn now can only be a base to what I'm try to achieve in the far future and
learning new things is a mandatory in this dynamic world, especially for people who
are interested in tech related majors. I recently have been attending some courses given through the online learning platform called Coursera which I got it through a
scholarship program given by a local organization. I have great desire into AI related disciplines and I have been learning courses like Machine learning, Data
Science specialization, AI for Everyone, Data Science math Skills which are the future sciences which have a lot of potential and also interesting fields. I am glad
that SUTD has AI based courses and I'm hopeful to attend them at your school.  
Since my early days in elementary school, I have been chosen to be a leader in cases like group works or projects and occasions like these have helped me to have,
as what I believe, a better leadership quality sufficient enough to influence those
around me. I was serious on group assignments and made sure that everybody did their part and pushed them to use what they have. Some of my friends told me that
 they didn't know the influence I had on them in terms of the way I unknowingly lead them score better in exams and how the competitive nature we had gave them the inspiration to do more and work for more.
